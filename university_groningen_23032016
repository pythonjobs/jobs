 +# Overview
 +
 +The Kapteyn Astronomical Institute of the University of Groningen seeks a scientific python programmer for the Euclid Netherlands Science Data Centre (SDC-NL). The SDC-NL will be operated as a partnership between the Kapteyn Astronomical Institute and the Donald Smits Centre of Information Technology. The Euclid mission has been selected for the Cosmic Visions Program of the European Space Agency. The primary goal of the mission is to investigate the nature of dark energy and dark matter by measuring the accelerated expansion of the universe using different independent methods. The Euclid satellite is expected to be launched in 2020 and has a mission lifetime of five years. The SDC-NL is one of eight national data centres which will share the Euclid processing.
 +
 +The Kapteyn Institute has particular responsibilities for the development of two key components of the Euclid Science Ground System. Firstly it is the co-lead of the organisation unit responsible for processing the large quantity of ground-based data required by the Euclid mission. Secondly, it leads the development of the Euclid Archive System (EAS), in cooperation with the European Space Astronomy Centre in Madrid. The EAS is a core component of the distributed Euclid Science Ground System and underpins all the Euclid processing. Job description. The EAS will be implemented entirely i Python.
 +
 +We seek a scientific programmer to take a major role in the SDC-NL. Prototypes of the external data processing pipelines and the EAS have already been developed. These prototypes are written entirely in Python and draw heavily on the technologies used in the successful Astro-WISE system, which was developed for the processing of data from the OmegaCAM instrument on the Very-large Survey Telescope (VST).
 +
 +For information or applications you can contact the Dr. O.R. Williams, o.r.williams@rug.nl. Applications should take the form of a CV and a letter of motivation. Closing date for applications is 31st March 2016.
 +
 +Please send a CV to the address above.

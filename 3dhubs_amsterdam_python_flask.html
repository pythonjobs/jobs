# Overview

At 3D Hubs we are doing something that has never been done before; decentralising manufacturing by connecting people who want to 3D print to the people owning the machines.
Today, 3D Hubs provides over 1 billion people access to a 3D printer within 10 miles of their home, that's almost 15% of the world population.

As our new Python Engineer you are committed to clean, stable and scalable code, that creates and connects content to the API.
You have done large scale projects in Python and Flask, SQLAlchemy or similar. 
Databases have no secrets to you and you can speak the language of complex queries. 
You are wired like an entrepreneur, quickly grasping the insights and taking action.

# Overview

At 3D Hubs we are doing something that has never been done before; decentralising manufacturing by connecting people who want to 3D print to the people owning the machines.
Today, 3D Hubs provides over 1 billion people access to a 3D printer within 10 miles of their home, that's almost 15% of the world population.

As our new Python Engineer you are committed to clean, stable and scalable code, that creates and connects content to the API.

# Overview

We're building a reliable, low-latency, highly concurrent system capable of scaling to thousands of executions per second with sub-millisecond latency. Whether you want to work on the exchange platform, the front-end or trading mechanisms, you'll be solving real and challenging problems - from pushing Python performance to new heights to handling real-time design constraints.


The Smarkets platform is written predominantly in Python and Erlang, and relies heavily on asynchronous programming techniques. We use REST where we can, and deploy to production several times a day.


Our software stack is built around Linux, Vagrant, Flask, Postgres, RabbitMQ, Git and Ansible.

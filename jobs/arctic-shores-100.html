# About Us

Arctic Shores is a startup company based in the heart of Manchester, UK. We're behind the UK's first mobile games based psychometric test for recruitment and selection combining rigorous science with honest fun.

# Our company

We're a small company with a diverse and talented team, including games developers, web developers, psychologists, data scientists and graphic artists. We deliver games that collect and upload a huge amount of data about the actions and decisions a player makes during gameplay. Our servers manage everything from the management and provision of players to machine learning analysis of gameplay data to data visualisation and reporting to clients.

Our development team is based in our 7th floor office with great views of Manchester. We also have staff in our satellite office in Central London.

We believe that our software is already best-in-breed and we're continuing to extend and improve our server application with novel features. To achieve this, we're looking to hire a developer to become the hub of our server development expertise, and to help us continue to plan, innovate and develop our server software.

# About the role

We're looking for an all-rounder focussing on the back end with a good dose of front end. You'll be as comfortable optimising a query on a PostgreSQL database and extending our REST APIs as you are tweaking a bespoke d3.js graph of a Gaussian distribution of psychometric scores.

# About you

You'll care about attention to detail, proper testing and have a logical approach to troubleshooting, and you'll think about the user experience as much as the functionality.

# Responsibilities

* Primary server/web developer responsible for new projects and new functionality.
* Explore, plan and develop innovative new functionality and features on our server/web platform.
* Provide technical support for our internal and external client base.
* Manage the server infrastructure.

# Technical skills

Essential:

* Experienced Python developer.
* Django, with 2+ years experience.
* Strong HTML, CSS and Javascript skills.
* Linux operations experience including databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL) and web servers (Nginx, Apache).
* Source control with Git.

Desirable:

* Experience with Ansible, Fabric or similar automation tools.
* Experience of Bootstrap, Sass and working with responsive front-ends.
* Experience of DigitalOcean, Linode or similar hosting platforms.
* Comfortable using scientific libraries such as Pandas and Numpy.

# What we're offering

* A competitive salary.
* 37.5 hours a week.
* 25 days paid holiday per year in addition to normal UK holidays.

# And finally...

We are a small team building ground-breaking mobile applications and server platforms. This is a key appointment for us as we look to grow our diverse and talented team.

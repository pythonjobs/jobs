# About Us 

Open Data Services is an established workers co-operative delivering sustainable support for world-changing open data projects, including the Open Contracting Data Standard, the 360Giving open philanthropy initiative, the International Aid Transparency Initiative (IATI), Open Referral and the Beneficial Ownership Data Standard.

We’re an interdisciplinary team, with developers, analysts and researchers working together to create tools and services that help organisations publish and use open data for social change.

Since we started in 2015 we’ve grown from 4 to 16 staff and co-operative members, providing family-friendly and flexible working. We’re creating a great place to work, whilst contributing to open data impacts across the world. We were recently featured in the 2018 UK Co-operative Economy report and Coop News.

We welcome applications from under-represented groups and we value diversity within our workforce. We don’t discriminate on age, disability, gender or gender reassignment, marriage or civil partnership, pregnancy and parenthood, race, religion or belief, sex, or sexual orientation.

# About the Job

We’re looking for a developer to join our small friendly team within a technology co-operative. We work on projects that use open data for social change.


You will:

  *  Build and maintain open source tools to help with the preparation, publication, processing and application of open data to unlock its social and political potential;
  *  Develop and maintain data standards, and data standard extensions, for a range of data standards, including Open Contracting, Beneficial Ownership & 360Giving (all of which use JSON Schema), and IATI (which uses XML Schema);
  *  Work as part of the development team to deliver both stable products and rapid prototypes for our partners, and to support key open data standards;
  *  Engage with growing user communities around data standards;
  *  Get involved in planning, deploying and testing code and user experience;
  *  Get involved in the wider work of the co-operative, supporting communities and organisations across the world to understand open data, to publish data using open standards, and to reuse data in accessible, user-centred tools and services.

We have a strong commitment to free and open source software, rooted in our co-operative ethics.

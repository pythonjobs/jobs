We are looking for an **Experienced Python Software Developer**

Adspert was founded in 2010 in Berlin and develops automated solutions for performance-oriented advertising.

**Our team** is passionately working on bid management systems of the future. With us you can expect a friendly atmosphere and a healthy work-life balance. You can choose to work remote only, use our office in the centre of Berlin, or mix both.

**We develop** our solutions mainly with Python and PostgreSQL and work on Linux and Mac. Distributed version control, code reviews, good test coverage and automated deployments are fundamental to our development process.

**You are** a motivated developer with at least 4 years of professional experience who is excited about analyzing problems and the development of appropriate solutions, while also having a product-oriented perspective on the problems you are going to solve.

You have very good English language skills, advanced Python skills, experience with relational databases (ideally PostgreSQL) and worked on web APIs.

If you also have experience with managing cloud-based infrastructure or system monitoring tools that would be considered a plus.

**We need you** to support us in improving and extending:

- applications for efficient synchronization of large data sets with the APIs of advertising platforms like Google Ads and Amazon Advertising
- internal and customer-facing web applications and APIs
- our optimization engine for online advertising
- deployment and monitoring processes for applications and infrastructure

**Have we sparked your interest?**

At the moment we can only accept applications from EU nationals.

# Overview

With a Staff of 5700, Forschungszentrum Jülich - a member of the Helmholtz Association - is one of the largest interdisciplinary research centers in Europe. The Jülich Centre for Neutron Science (JCNS) operates neutron scattering instruments at world leading sources in Garching, Grenoble and Oak Ridge, make them accessible to external users, and uses them for its own research on magnetism and soft matter. Furthermore, the JCNS is a major contributor to the European Spallation Source (ESS) that is currently built in Lund.

In the Scientific Computing Group of JCNS at the Heinz Maier-Leibnitz Zentrum (MLZ) in Garching we develop software for the analysis of scattering experiments, and support Instrument users. In close collaboration with the Data Management and Software Center of the ESS in Copenhagen, we will also develop software for reflectometers and quasielastic spectrometers of the ESS. Through this German in-kind contribution to the ESS, we currently have two openings for postdoctoral scientific software developers.

We are looking to recruit a as soon as possible two

# Job Description

We are looking for Python developers to join our teams in Canary Wharf and St. Pauls. We consider developers from all backgrounds and all levels of experience. Developers from non-financial backgrounds are welcome to apply.

We can offer flexible conditions and a stimulating, creative atmosphere.

# Restrictions

* No telecommuting
* No agencies please

# Requirements

Fluency in core Python, its types and standard library. Anything else you might bring to the job is a bonus. We use a lot of other technologies: in an organisation as big as Bank of America we have just about any technology you might think of.

But if you come to us with the ability to use Python well, then we might not ask what else you know about. Python is very important to us - and finding people who can use the language well is one of our highest priorities.

If you fit this description, please just email a CV to salim.fadhley@baml.com or call me on 0207 995 1134. There's no need to send a covering letter (unless you really want to) and you don't need an appointment to call me.

# About the Company

Bank of America Merrill Lynch is a multinational banking and financial services corporation. We are an equal opportunities employer and positively encourage applications from suitably qualified and eligible candidates regardless of sex, race, disability, age, sexual orientation, religion or belief.

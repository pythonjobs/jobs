  - Intermediate HTML and CSS skills.

  - Enough experience with Python to feel comfortable tackling everyday web programming tasks.

#About Bookitbee

Bookitbee is a fast growing online ticketing service allowing anyone to sell tickets to their event: it provides a simple online event booking and ticketing service, allowing people to set-up, promote and manage their events – all from one easy to use dashboard.

We do work hard in our team, but only when it makes sense to do so. If you want to work flexible hours, that’s fine. Or if you want to work from home, that’s fine too. Having said that, most people are in the office at least 3 days a week.

When we are all together, it’s in a lovely space close to the centre of Edinburgh. It may not have the usual start-up standards of a table tennis table or bean bags, but it is an environment where everyone is encouraged to share their views and suggestions, diversity is valued, people are given the autonomy to handle their own work schedule and where everyone gets given the support to succeed. In return for your commitment and expertise, we offer a great salary, share options (coming soon), 25 days annual leave and the opportunity to be part of something special.

The [Open Syllabus Project](http://explorer.opensyllabusproject.org/) is
an academic data mining project based at Columbia University that’s
analyzing a corpus of 1M+ college course syllabi. We’re building a wide
range of tools and services for audiences both inside and outside the
university. We aim to:

-   Help instructors discover new resources and design courses.
-   Help university administrators understand the structure of the
    offerings at their institutions, and to help librarians allocate
    resources for books, databases, and services.
-   Develop  new scholarly metrics that capture which resources are
    being used in the classroom.
-   Build book recommendation services for lifelong learning
-   Analyze trends in the sequencing of books and concepts on syllabi,
    to build a “dependency graph” of knowledge.

We launched a beta version of the project with an op-ed in the New York
Times last year.  Since then the project has appeared in Nature, Time,
The Washington Post, The Chronicle of Higher Education, MarketWatch, Der
Spiegel, Business Insider, Lifehacker, FiveThirtyEight, WNYC, QZ, and
elsewhere. It’s also been picked up by major news outlets in Europe,
Russia, China, Japan, South Korea, Ukraine, Egypt, and Mexico. With new
funding from the Sloan, Hewlett, and Templeton foundations, we’re
working towards second release of the project that will feature much
larger collections of syllabi, books, authors, institutions, and
publishers.

We’re hiring a full-stack web applications developer to take a leading
role in the development of these public-facing web services. We’re
looking for a developer who has significant experience at both layers of
the web stack – someone who enjoys building large, stateful Javascript
applications, and also is able to build and maintain the server-side
APIs that feed these client applications.

**Responsibilities**

-   Build a API in Python (Flask or Django) that organizes the results
    of the metadata extraction pipeline into web-facing data stores
    (Elasticsearch, Postgres) and exposes well-structured REST endpoints
    for the client application.
-   In collaboration with designers and contract developers, build a
    front-end application using React and Redux / MobX that surfaces the
    data on the web.
-   Work with the data engineering team to define data requirements for
    the front end application.

**Requirements**

-   3+ years of professional experience in software engineering.
-   Demonstrated ability to build high-quality, performant, maintainable
    web applications that serve sizable traffic.
-   Experience building large, stateful Javascript applications with
    React and React-ecosystem libraries like Redux and MobX.
-   Experience with modern Javascript build tools like Webpack or Gulp.
-   Experience with server-side Python development with Flask or Django.
-   Commitment to sustainable engineering practices – automated testing
    and deployment, continuous integration, and reproducible development
    environments.
-   An eye for clean, readable, extensible, well-tested code.
-   Experience with remote / distributed collaboration on GitHub.
-   Ability to work in a team environment, but also the initiative to
    take on difficult, open-ended problems and see them to completion.
-   Committed to building a tolerant, respectful, and safe work
    environment.

**Nice to have**

-   Experience with Elasticsearch
-   Experience with infrastructure automation tools like Ansible
-   Data visualization with d3

First and foremost – we’d love to find a collaborator who can contribute
new ideas and help drive the project in new directions. OSP is strongly
committed to building a diverse engineering team.

**Salary**: Competitive

**Commitment**: Full-time for 2 years, renewable.

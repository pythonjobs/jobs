# WHO WE ARE

At MADE.COM we believe that everyone should have access to great design, so we’ve taken a unique approach to making and selling furniture - no middlemen, no agents or importers and no high street stores. Instead we work directly with designers and manufacturers so we can offer high-end furniture at up to 70% off the high street prices.

It’s not an easy task – and it takes a creative and dedicated team to make it happen. Everyone has an important part to play in our technology department. We combine our individual passions and skills to create innovative solutions that are as exciting and unconventional as the business itself. It’s a place where all ideas are listened to, where brainstorming means job titles get left at the door and where a self-starter can really make their mark.

**About us**

At Essentia, we’re a friendly bunch of ex-fund managers, neuroscientists, quants and developers who are breaking new ground in the application of behavioural science to financial markets. 

We enable our clients - investment professionals, portfolio managers and fund managers -  to capture rich data about their behaviour and thought-process, which we turn into compelling, actionable visualisations and insights. They then use this information to make better investment decisions, and ultimately, improve their fund performance. We are just under 2 years old, but have already made great headway in our market, won numerous awards and been featured widely in the press.

You can get a feel of what it is like working here by taking a look [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9M6CtGMM-6M) - we all genuinely love it! 

**About you**

We are looking for someone who wants to work on a genuinely innovative, cloud based, big data analytics platform to join us in our office in Notting Hill. 
 
**Skills and Requirements**

As a junior developer, we don’t expect you to know everything all at once, but we do expect you to have a great attitude. We have a world class team, so we’ll help bring you along and get you up to speed.

- Highly secure, encrypted data systems
- Large, mixed schema data set management
- Server administration and dev-ops

- Experience supporting a high availability system.
- Financial data

If you think this a great description of you, please get in touch with a cover letter that explains why you think you're the right person for the role. 

We want to hear your voice in it - CVs with form letters (or without letters) won't be considered. In addition, a web-presence that shows what you can do (github, programming blogs, portfolios etc.) makes it a lot easier for us to hire you!  To apply, please send your CV and cover letter to jobs@essentia-analytics.com quoting ref PGH3.

You must have the right to work in the UK. 

We only accept applications directly from candidates, no agents please.

# Octopus Energy

We're a 6-month-old, tech-focussed energy supplier for the UK based in London
with around 25 staff (with around 7 in the engineering team). 

There's a great opportunity for disruption in the UK energy market at the
moment. The big suppliers still dominate, but are not exactly popular.  The
energy landscape is changing as we move to more disaggregated forms of
generation, with less predictability, more dynamism and smarter technology.

You'll be working for a company that is helping address climate change. We'll
be helping move people onto using greener technology and consuming energy from
renewable sources. This will all help transition the UK towards a lower carbon
future.

# Tech

We're building a modern, event-driven infrastructure for interacting with both
consumers (via the web, mobile apps and smart-meters) and the industry (eg data
flows, consumption forecasting, trading on the wholesale market).

We use Python heavily: our consumer-facing site is powered by Django and the
Django-REST-framework amongst other things - we also use Pandas, Numpy and
Jupyter for analysis and forecasting. We also use React and React-native for
client-side and mobile development.

We use AWS heavily, employing most of the Hashistack (Vagrant, Packer, Consul,
Terraform) in some form. We use Kanban and employ CircleCI and Atlas to
coordinate a continuous deployment pipeline. See, for example,
http://tech.octopus.energy/2016/05/05/django-elb-health-checks.html

Engineering standards are high. Everything we do is well tested and reviewed
before it reaches production.

# You?

We're looking for strong engineers to join our team as we have a host of meaty
challenges to solve. Python/Django experience would be an advantage but not a
necessity - we're interested in talking to any candidate with a good track
record and an interest in green energy. There's no minimum level of experience
required: we'll consider everyone from graduates upwards.

You will need to be a quick learner with good attention to detail. The energy
industry is complicated so we're keen to hire developers with good domain
modelling skills, or experience with tackling complex domains.

Bonus points for experience with:

- Numpy, Pandas or other data-science tools
- Non-trivial Postgres experience
- Experience with AWS and/or the Hashistack
- Experience with service-driven architectures and message brokers

To apply, send a short email and CV to talent@octopus.energy explaining why you're a
strong candidate.

Note, we're only considering candidates who don't require a visa to work in the
UK.

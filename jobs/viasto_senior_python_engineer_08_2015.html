## About viasto

viasto is a Software-as-a-Service company, based in the center of Berlin. Our product, the interview suite, allows companies to get to know their job applicants via video in order to avoid wrong selection decisions, mainly in high-volume recruitment processes. Our service is used by large corporations, such as Beiersdorf, Microsoft and Telekom, as well as successful startups like Goodgame Studios, Lovoo and Trivago. We are growing at a sustainable rate and our customers rarely ever cancel. Many are increasingly rolling out our software into other countries and regions.

Our development team currently consists of 7 developers, and we are looking for new team members with strong experience and a passion for best development practices.

* Very good communication skills and business fluent English (German is not required, but would be an advantage)
* Finally, we appreciate great team spirit, a sound business understanding and the motivation to build fantastic products.

## What we offer

* Interesting and challenging work on market-proven products that already positively affect the future career decisions of tens of thousands of professionals in various countries

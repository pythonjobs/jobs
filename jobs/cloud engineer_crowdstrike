CrowdStrike is looking to hire a Senior Cloud Engineer to build large scale cloud-based cybersecurity systems using Golang, Python, Cassandra, Elasticsearch, AWS.

We’re looking for a highly-technical, hands-on engineer who loves to operate at scale and build globally distributed, fault tolerant and highly scalable cloud-based critical systems.

About Us
CrowdStrike is a leading provider of next-generation endpoint protection, threat intelligence, and pre/post incident response services. We are the fastest growing endpoint protection company, one of the World's Most 50 Innovative Companies according to MIT, and one of Forbes Most Promising Companies. Our growth and innovation are driven by incredible employees who deliver unmatched customer success.

You will…

Lead backend engineering efforts from rapid prototypes to large-scale application services across CrowdStrike products
Make it possible for internal teams to easily work with data at the petabyte scale
Leverage and build cloud based services to support our top rated security intelligence platform
Work with security researchers to troubleshoot time-sensitive production issues
Keep petabytes of critical business data safe, secure, and available
Brainstorm, define, and build collaboratively with members across multiple teams
Obsess about learning, and champion the newest technologies & tricks with others, raising the technical IQ of the team
Be mentored and mentor other developers on web, backend and data storage technologies and our system
Constantly re-evaluate our product to improve architecture, knowledge models, user experience, performance and stability
Be an energetic ‘self-starter’ with the ability to take ownership and be accountable for deliverables
Use and give back to the open source community
 

You'll use…

Golang
Python
Cassandra
Kafka

SQL
Redis
ZMQ
Hadoop
AWS Cloud
Git
Qualifications:

Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science (or commensurate experience in data structures/algorithms/distributed systems)
The ability to design scalable and re-usable SOA services
The ability to scale backend systems – sharding, partitioning, scaling horizontally are second nature to you
The desire to ship code and the love of seeing your bits run in production
Deep understanding of distributed systems and scalability challenges
Deep understand multi-threading, concurrency, and parallel processing technologies
Team player skills – we embrace collaborating as a team as much as possible
A thorough understanding of engineering best practices from appropriate testing paradigms to effective peer code reviews and resilient architecture
The ability to thrive in a fast paced, test-driven, collaborative and iterative programming environment
The skills to meet your commitments on time and produce high quality software that is unit tested, code reviewed, and checked in regularly for continuous integration

Bonus points awarded for:

Contributions to the open source community (GitHub, Stack Overflow, blogging)
Existing exposure to Go, Scala, AWS, Cassandra, Kafka, Redis, Splunk
Prior experience in the cybersecurity or intelligence fields
  

Bring your experience in distributed technologies and algorithms, your great API and systems design sensibilities, and your passion for writing code that performs at extreme scale. You will help build a platform that scales to millions of events per second and Terabytes of data per day.

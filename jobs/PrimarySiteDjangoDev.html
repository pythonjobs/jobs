This is an exceptional opportunity to be a key part of a team of eight developers and three sysadmins at PrimarySite, the leading provider of primary school websites.
## About PrimarySite

We’re a 60 person company formed over ten years ago who build great products for primary schools to save them time and money, whilst enabling them to communicate more effectively with parents. Our office is located in the centre of Newark, with easy access to both train stations and the A1.

## About the team
You would be joining us as a member of the Product Development team, working on-site with the Product Owner. We use the Kanban methodology, and support several different applications — mostly built as micro-services.
Our team’s work is of a high quality — every line of code is peer reviewed. We constantly work to improve our processes and currently score a 10 out of 12 on the Joel Test

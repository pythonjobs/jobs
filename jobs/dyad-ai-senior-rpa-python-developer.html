## The Role
We are looking for a results-driven software developer to take ownership of a Python-based Robotic Process Automation (RPA) system that is a part of our BetterLetter product. The ideal person for this role would be someone with senior-level or greater Python skills along with strong self-management and research abilities; experience with RPA in general and Robot Framework, in particular, would be valuable but is not required. This role is only open to candidates living and working in the UK and would require at least 1-2 in-office days at the beginning in our London office in order to onboard (after which remote work would be possible).


## Responsibilities
- Work closely with the Product and Primary Care Operations teams to acquire the necessary domain knowledge and plan work
- Develop and maintain a Python-based RPA bot system for Windows software
- Provide support for users of the bot systems in task execution
- Deliver high-quality and robust code in a challenging integration domain (healthcare systems).
- Develop and own API-based integration for clinical systems as they become available

### Requirements

Must have:
- At least 7 years of commercial Python experience, including a proven track record of production solutions in use.
- Demonstrable knowledge of software design and testing skills, including Four Rules of Simple Design, SOLID, and mocks.
- A strong ability to work independently in a new and complex domain.
- Very strong collaboration and communication skills.
- Interest in constant professional growth, including gradually learning Elixir in which our main product is written.

Nice to have:

- Experience with RPA is a strong plus, and experience with Robot Framework, in particular, would be a strong plus. However, the RF Framework is easy for a strong Python developer to pick up and understand, so we encourage applications even if youâ€™ve not used it or done RPA before.
- Knowledge of NHS GP clinical systems
- Experience building and working in regulated industries with strong data protection requirements
- Agile and XP mindset

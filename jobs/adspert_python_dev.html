We are looking for a **Python Software Developer**

**Note: The position is full-time and based in our Berlin office, therefore if you are outside of Berlin you must be prepared to relocate for this role.**

Adspert was founded in Berlin in 2010 and our innovative technology was launched just one year later. Based on trading systems, Adspert automatically organizes and optimizes online advertising. Bertelsmann Digital Media Investment and K-Invest support Adspert as strategic partners and investors.

**Our team** in the centre of Berlin is passionately working on bid management systems of the future. With us you can expect a friendly atmosphere and a healthy work-life balance.

**We develop** our solutions with Python, Go, JavaScript and PostgreSQL and mainly work on Linux and Mac. Distributed version control, good test coverage and automated deployment are fundamental to our development process.

**You are** a motivated developer with a couple of years of professional experience who is excited about analyzing problems and the development of appropriate solutions.

You have very good English language skills, advanced Python skills, solid JavaScript knowledge, and experience with relational databases (ideally PostgreSQL).

If you also have experience with Go, web applications, cloud-based infrastructure (e.g. AWS EC2) or monitoring tools (Nagios, Graphite, Prometheus), that would be considered a plus.

**We need you** to support us in improving and extending:

- our optimization engine for online advertising (Python, Go, SQL).
- applications for efficient synchronization of large data sets with the APIs of advertising platforms like Google AdWords and Microsoft BingAds.
- internal and customer-facing web applications (Python, JavaScript).
- deployment and monitoring processes for applications and infrastructure (AWS EC2, Ansible, Nagios, Graphite).

**Have we piqued your interest?**

Apply now! Send your application including salary expectation and possible starting date to [jobs@adspert.net](mailto:jobs@adspert.net).

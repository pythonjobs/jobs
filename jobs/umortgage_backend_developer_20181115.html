At Unmortgage we want to enable everyone to live in the home they want. We are
opening up home ownership by co-investing with people who haven't been able to
buy yet.

Over the next 18 months we will help 2,000 customers find their dream home. We
are looking for a Backend Developer to join the Unmortgage dev team.

# You

We are looking for good people first, and skilled developers second, if you
feel like you match a lot of the below requirements but not all of them, send
us a message and lets have a chat, you may have a bunch of skills we didn't
know we wanted!

## Who you are

* You’ll have worked within an agile dev team before.
* You’ll have a pragmatic approach and enjoy being a valued team player.
* You’ll be inquisitive. Keen to build out great user experiences.
* You’ll innovate. Bringing new concepts and technologies to the table.
* You’ll be open to feedback. And also give it.
* You’ll enjoy learning from others. Being a mentor yourself. 

## The skills you’ll have
  
* Python! We are looking for candidates with at least a couple of years of
  practical experience writing python.
* Test first mentality. Be it TDD or BDD or RDD or some other DD, writing well
  tested and maintainable code should be your default setting, not something
  you are bullied into.
* Must write good (for documentation reasons).
* Can design a good RESTful API.

Education is not super important to us. We’re looking for great candidates with
front line experience of web applications running at scale. 

# Us

This isn't going to be a boring job. Buying a home is one of the most
life-changing things people ever do. At Unmortgage, we walk this journey with
our customers, guiding them through every step. Reporting to Oisin

you will be building backend systems that help facilitate the entire home
buying experience, optimising and speeding up the process to make it a truly
incredible experience for our customers.

Fairness is our core value and drives everything we do. It allows us to balance
the home owning aspirations of our customers with our investors' needs for
financial security. It also governs how we treat each other.

Come build the future of home ownership with us!

## What you'll do

* Designing, building and maintaining the platform services/infrastructure.
* Integrating with external services e.g. payment providers.
* Aiding the collection and cleaning of data for our data team.

* We work in two week sprints from Tuesday to Tuesday. Using the Agile XP story
  planning game.

  our work.

## Interview

Our interview process is designed to be quick and respectful. We're looking for
people who are good at what they do and would fit us culturally. So we:
* have a quick call
* ask you to complete a short technical test
* invite you in to meet the people you’ll be working with and go through the
  technical test, there may be some live coding involved but 
* spend some time with the wider team, after which we’ll make you an offer

End-to-end the process takes 2-7 working days, depending on your availability.

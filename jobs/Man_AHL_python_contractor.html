# Overview

A contractor is required to port existing python applications on to RHEL 7 using Docker. The port includes: ensuring tests run, Dockerisation, service discovery considerations, deploying secrets through ansible, integration with Docker compose, checking database connections, assessing file dependencies including logging, & updating 3rd party dependencies where necessary.


# Working Here
AHL has a small company, no-attitude feel. It is flat structured, open, transparent and collaborative. We are actively engaged with the broader technology community through [PyData](https://www.meetup.com/PyData-London-Meetup/) and [Machine Learning](https://www.meetup.com/London-Machine-Learning-Meetup/) Meetups. We open-source some of our technology; see our [github](https://github.com/manahl)

# Introduction

Genomics plc was launched in 2014 by four leading statistical geneticists at the University of Oxford, and is a leading analysis company developing algorithms and software solutions to uncover the relationships between genetic variation and human disease.

We have recently signed collaboration agreements with Oxford University and the Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust in a research project where our bioinformatics tools will be applied to analyse and interpret up to 500 genome sequences focusing on rare diseases and cancer. We also have several existing partnerships with large pharmaceutical companies, and in clinical genomics are a platform partner for Genomics England, the company undertaking the 100,000 Genomes project in the UK.

# The Role

We are seeking an experienced Python developer with a background in statistics to work on our platform for the statistical interpretation of genetic data. You will join a cross-functional agile software development team, working with talented software engineers and statistical geneticists within a fast growing start-up company. The ideal candidate would be a highly motivated software professional who continuously seeks to improve the team's software development process. You should enjoy pair programming as an opportunity to share knowledge and exchange ideas.

You should have:

* A good degree (preferably PhD) in mathematics or statistics

* A solid understanding of classical and Bayesian statistics
* Enthusiasm for empirical data analysis and a pragmatic approach to modelling
* A passion for agile software development practices, including Continuous Delivery and Acceptance Test Driven Development
* Ability to communicate complex ideas to people with a range of technical backgrounds.

Ideally you should also have:

* Experience of prototyping in R
* Knowledge of statistical genetics
* Familiarity with modern C++
* Experience of DevOps and release/deployment automation
* An appreciation of data protection and security issues, and of their implications on system design
* An interest in working for an early-stage start-up company.

All candidates must have the right to work in the UK to be considered.

# Job Description

We are looking for a developer with experience in test design and automation to join our team based in Central London.

We are looking for a candidate who brings considerable experience in testing. We need a candidate who can go beyond the creation of unit-tests: We need an individual who can be an advocate for automating every kind of test. Your goal will be to eliminate the need for any kind of manual testing. The sucsessful candidate will be able to help teams become better test-driven developers.

We consider developers from all backgrounds and all levels of experience. Previous financial experience might be beneficial but is not a requirement for this role.

We can offer flexible conditions and a stimulating, creative atmosphere.

# Restrictions

* No telecommuting
* No agencies please

# Requirements

* Fluency in at least one major programming-language.
* Demonstrable experience in test-driven development, developing and implementing test-strategies for large applications.
* Expertise with testing software such as CI and headless browsers.

But if you come to us with the ability to use Python well and a GitHub project full of interesting, relevant code - then we might not ask what else you know about. Testing is very important to us - and finding people who can do it well is one of our highest priorities.

# How to apply

Please just email a resume to salim.fadhley@baml.com. We do not require a covering letter but we do love to see GitHub links.

Our assessment process may include the following:
* A web-based programming challenge to be completed in your own time
* At least one face-to-face interview, which will include a pair-programming exercise
* A review of your CV and previous work.

# About the Company

Bank of America Merrill Lynch is a multinational banking and financial services corporation. We are an equal opportunities employer and positively encourage applications from suitably qualified and eligible candidates regardless of sex, race, disability, age, sexual orientation, religion or belief.

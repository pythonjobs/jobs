# Job Description

We are looking for a developer with experience in test design and automation to join our team based in Central London. This role is available to contractors and individuals seeking permanent roles.

We need an individual who can be an advocate for automating every kind of test. Your goal will be to eliminate the need for any kind of manual testing. The successful candidate will be able to help teams become better test-driven developers.

We can offer flexible conditions and a stimulating, creative atmosphere.

# Restrictions

* No telecommuting
* No agencies please

# Requirements

* Fluency in at least one major programming-language.
* Demonstrable experience in test-driven development, developing and implementing test-strategies for large applications.

# How to apply

Please just email a CV to salim.fadhley@baml.com. We do not require a covering letter but we do love to see your GitHub (or any other interesting, public programming work). We consider developers from all backgrounds and all levels of experience. Previous financial experience might be beneficial but is not a requirement for this role.

Our assessment process may include the following:
* A web-based programming challenge to be completed in your own time
* A technical office-based interview, which will include a pair-programming exercise
* A discussion of your CV and previous work history

If you have any questions about the assessment process please ask.

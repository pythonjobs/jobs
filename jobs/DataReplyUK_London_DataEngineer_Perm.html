# Overview

We have open positions for Data Engineers to join our growing consultancy startup.

You will be working with the latest tools and technologies but above all else what matters is how you think. We are looking for candidates with an engineering background. We are particularly interested in speaking with you if you have personally implemented a distributed computing infrastructure and the related software stack to support a Data Science team.

We have openings at different seniority levels. If you meet most but not all requirements your application could still be of interest.



Each project or engagement is different, but in general the aim is to answer a business question using available data, or to build a solution to a data-based problem. Our Data Engineers directly enable this by giving the team the tools they need to get the job done, gathering and organizing disparate data sets and ensuring those tools perform and scale well.

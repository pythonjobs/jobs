<h2>Project Description</h2>

Our client stores lab-analysis data on an FTP server for over 3000 customers, but those customers have no ability to access this digital data. 
We are building a web application that allows customers to log in and view their lab analyses.
We have finished designing & building the front end Angular app. 
We made significant progress on a Scala backend, but decided to scrap it in favor for a simpler Python + Django backend solution. 
We are looking for a developer to build this Python back end while working closely with the project manager and front end developer.

<h2>Project Requirements</h2>
This contract project requires a Python/Django app to be built with the following goals:
--Grab lab-analysis data from an external FTP server, then parse and save this data in our Postgres DB. 
--Create REST APIs to access the saved data in Postgres, which our Angular App will consume. 
--Utilize some user-management solution that allows clients to access their unique data, reset their password, add/remove users from teams, etc. Ideally, an existing framework is used for this functionality, as we donâ€™t want to build a user management system from scratch.
We have clear functional specs, a Postgres schema defined and implemented, APIs already defined, and a solid Angular app built. This should be relatively straightforward effort.

You will be the sole backend engineer on this project. We need someone with strong abilities to execute. 
We will need a full proposal on level of effort, time estimations, and agreed upon milestones.
Remote is fine. We can meet in person in the SF bay area & Portland (if you happen to be in either locations).

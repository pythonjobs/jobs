# Overview
We are looking for a Python Backend Developer to join us as we build Newzoo Expert.

Newzoo Expert uniquely offers a complete view of the games market and industry ecosystem with metrics ranging from player engagement and revenues to viewership and demographics. We track and analyze consumer engagement from every angle. We understand what target audiences are playing, watching, and talking about. We can analyze per market and competitor's performance. We are building a full 360 degree engagement data & ecosystem insights platform.

# Our Ideal Candidate
We want to hear from candidates who are motivated and take a keen interest in self-improvement. For example, you may have written a REST API in Python before. Were you happy with the results? Do you have an opinion on what could have been improved? Will you be willing to try new technologies and approaches?

You will be expected to contribute towards technical discussions, e.g. technical stack and architecture. You will work closely with stakeholders and frontend developers, taking the initiative to propose improvements and to fix issues before they escalate into serious problems.

You should have 5+ years of experience working as a backend developer.

We are open to remote candidates who are able to work in the CET timezone. All candidates must be fluent in English.

# Our Technical Stack
These are some of the technologies you will work with in this role.
• Python 3+ with libraries like Flask, SQLAlchemy, Marshmallow
• Kubernetes and docker
• PostgreSQL and Google BigQuery
• Google Cloud Platform
• Airflow

# What's It Like To Work Here
You will be part of the Engineering and Product Development team based out of our office in Amsterdam, a 10 minute cycle ride from Centraal. There's about 15 people in the group, though we are expanding. We have a CI/CD process and automated tests. Deployments to production happen weekly, though it is our ambition to increase this.

We work with Scrum, in weekly sprints. We adopt an accountability-based management style. We do not micromanage, instead communication channels within the team is open. Project management is done in a collaborative manner, you will contribute towards setting the weekly sprint goals (i.e. what we are committing to building that week). We expect you to be self-motivated and self-organising. We encourage experimenting with new technologies. We are Agile.

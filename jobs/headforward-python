# Overview

Python/Golang Developer: £30-£50K per anum
We’re an outsource development company based about 5 miles from the beach in Cornwall. We build dedicated teams for our clients, so there’s no sitting on the bench or swapping around. We’ve recently reached 100 employees but work in small teams so have the combination of a start-up feel with the security of a larger company. Our culture is pretty relaxed and work-life balance is important to us.

People are our number 1 priority and everything we do is to ensure that our teams are happy. We work and live in an amazing location which we make the most of whenever we can. A healthy work life balance is essential and we insist that people take breaks, this is not somewhere that you need to work extra hours in order to be noticed. Your code and your attitude are what will get you noticed here

What will you be doing?

You will be joining a fast-moving development team working on the backend of a cutting-edge web application for one of the largest telecoms companies in the world.

We are delivering multiple releases every day and working with some pretty exciting technologies alongside fully employing the use of Agile methodologies across the whole business.

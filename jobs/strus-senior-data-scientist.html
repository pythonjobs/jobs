# Senior Data Scientist
About the Team

STR’s Analytics division researches and develops advanced analytics and machine learning-based solutions to solve challenging problems related to national security. Our team consists of passionate and motivated engineers with advanced degrees in engineering, computer science, mathematics, and data science, who are seeking opportunities to use their deep technical knowledge and creativity to tackle some of the hardest problems that our customers face. Our projects span multiple different data modalities and incorporate advanced algorithms, deep learning, and statistical techniques to uncover patterns in social media, structured and unstructured text, time series, geospatial, and imagery data, and must operate under challenging constraints not typically found in the commercial world. The tools and technologies we develop have real world impact and US Government analysts use them to extract and enrich intelligence information around the globe.

The Role

As a Data Scientist, you will analyze a diverse collection of interesting and challenging datasets to develop, implement, and evaluate statistical machine learning algorithms to discover interesting trends and form valuable intelligence insights. You will apply state of the art and novel statistical modeling and machine learning techniques to a variety of problems including classification, anomaly detection, forecasting, and much more—all to help address national security and safety needs. You will work closely with other researchers to develop cutting edge systems and work collaboratively with our software engineers to design and deploy models into production. You will interact with customers to understand requirements and apply iterative feedback to development to respond to their most critical problems.

This position is based in Woburn, MA; applicants should expect to primarily work onsite.More information about the role...

We have a brilliantly talented and fun team! [http://skimlinks.com/company/team](http://skimlinks.com/company/team)

Described by Techcrunch as one of London's leading startups, and voted in the top 10 of the Guardian Tech Media Invest.

Brand new offices in the heart of Tech City. Openplan heaven!

Our annual festive season get-away/ mystery tour (recent trips include Rotterdam and Ljubljana). Our summer party. Our monthly birthday extravaganzas… Any excuse for a party really!

Skimbledon, our annual ping-pong tournament (we have a sound-proofed table tennis room in the office to minimize the disruption!).  There are also weekly poker showdowns, regular local football league games, pub quiz teams… We are a pretty competitive crew!

There are daily battles amongst team members to wrestle control of the music selection on Spotify. The office piano is also available if you are musically inclined.

Monthly free massages and a regular nail service in-office (Manlycures for the guys are on offer!)

We host meet-ups, brown bag lunches, product demos and have dedicated training time set aside for each and every team member (Skimovation time).

There is also the office beer fridge, catered lunches and regular office trips to the local pubs to wind down after a busy week.

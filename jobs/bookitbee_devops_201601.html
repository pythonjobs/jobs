#Job Description
As a DevOps engineer, you’ll be helping us grow our platform to support our fast growth as one of the UK’s leading online events companies.

You’ll enjoy working in a small co-operative team and your primary task will be to operate and improve our automated deployment and scaling infrastructure to ensure we can maintain our service standards during very high-demand events such as festivals and concerts. You will have a love of problem-solving and the ability to be responsive to fast-changing requirements.

As well as infrastructure, you’ll also contribute to our customer-facing platform with high-quality code and documentation. Experience using Python and ideally Django will put you in a great position to grow your contribution to the company; and in the future your role may grow to include mentoring junior staff and interns. As the development team grows, you may have the opportunity to move into a management role.

#Skills and Requirements

###You are

  - Fluent in written and spoken English and can communicate your ideas thoughtfully.
  - Curious and imaginative with a forward-thinking mindset.
  - Collaborate well with small teams.
  - Experienced in building resilient software.

###You should have
  - Broad web and Linux knowledge.
  - Some experience of scaling and hosting systems
  - In-depth experience with Linux admin and automated deployment tools.
  - Experience with AWS/Azure, Ansible, Postgres, Redis and Celery helps.
  - Polyglot programmers are welcome, but we would like to see 2+ years of commercial Python experience.

What’s most important however, is that you are a friendly person who loves computing, programming, problem solving and generally getting hands-on.

#About Bookitbee

Bookitbee is a fast growing online ticketing service allowing anyone to sell tickets to their event: it provides a simple online event booking and ticketing service, allowing people to set-up, promote and manage their events – all from one easy to use dashboard.

We do work hard in our team, but only when it makes sense to do so. If you want to work flexible hours, that’s fine. Or if you want to work from home, that’s fine too. Having said that, most people are in the office at least 3 days a week.

When we are all together, it’s in a lovely space close to the centre of Edinburgh. It may not have the usual start-up standards of a table tennis table or bean bags, but it is an environment where everyone is encouraged to share their views and suggestions, diversity is valued, people are given the autonomy to handle their own work schedule and where everyone gets given the support to succeed. In return for your commitment and expertise, we offer a great salary, share options (coming soon), 25 days annual leave and the opportunity to be part of something special.

# Real Time Audio with Cython

I'm working on an instrument sampler using Sounddevice. I have the majority of the work done, but I need to add realtime pitch changing (resampling) as well as 24/32bit support (currently it is stuck on 16bit). These are a bit above my expertise so I'm looking for a knoweldgeable developer who can help.

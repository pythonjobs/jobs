# The job
Let's trash talk (no pun intended), or more specifically, focus our energy how the power of technology can be harnessed for solid waste management and recycling. And why stop there; why not move beyond simply sorting and recycling, and actually find real value from trash!

* Do you want to help solve the menace of waste management?

* Are you a coding Ninja with superior data engineering skills in Python?

Intrigued? Let's talk further!

**

You will work with a small team of software engineers, architects, data scientists and operations managers, helping us propel towards our mission of zero landfill waste and promoting waste recycling.

## Who we are
Studies suggest that plastic waste flowing into oceans will triple if we fail to take any credible action on reducing the plastic menace. Despite proactive regulations are being devised to reduce this flow, plastics will continue to be one of the major contributors of pollution across the world. Radical innovations in plastic waste management are necessary to stem this flow and to tackle this menace. Bintix is at the cusp of such innovations in collection and management of waste that helps Households recycle every piece of plastics they dispose. Through a innovative use of data models, machine learning technologies, Bintix provides a new dimension of thinking that is necessary to ensure every piece of plastic is collected and managed correctly ensuring close to 100% aversion from water bodies, landfills and burning. Bintix needs all the help it can receive to scale it's model and promote innovations to ensure aversion.

Are you ready to be part of this impact?

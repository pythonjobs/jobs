*Closes 19th February.*

**Open Data Services is a growing workers co-operative.** We deliver sustainable support for world-changing open data projects, including the Open Contracting Data Standard, the 360Giving open philanthropy initiative and the International Aid Transparency Initiative (IATI).

We’re an interdisciplinary team, with developers, analysts and researchers working together to create sustainable tools and services that help organisations publish and use open data for social change.

Since we started in 2015 we’ve grown from 4 to 15 members of staff based across the UK, providing family-friendly and flexible working. We’re creating a great place to work, whilst contributing to open data impacts across the world.

**We’re now seeking new people to help develop software as part of projects that use open data for social change.**

We welcome applications from underrepresented minorities, and we value diversity within our workforce. If we can do anything to facilitate your application, please get in touch.

All employees are eligible to become co-operative members, taking an equal stake in the future development of our work.

New to co-ops? The Workers Co-operative Code provides more information about what makes a worker co-op different. We started with a collective structure, and this year have been exploring aspects of a self-managing team model.

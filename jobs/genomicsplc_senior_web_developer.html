# Introduction

Genomics plc was launched in 2014 by four leading statistical geneticists at the University of Oxford, and is a leading analysis company developing algorithms and software solutions to uncover the relationships between genetic variation and human disease.

We have recently signed collaboration agreements with Oxford University and the Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust in a research project where our bioinformatics tools will be applied to analyse and interpret up to 500 genome sequences focusing on rare diseases and cancer. We also have several existing partnerships with large pharmaceutical companies, and in clinical genomics are a platform partner for Genomics England, the company undertaking the 100,000 Genomes project in the UK.

# The Role

We are seeking an experienced Web Developer to work on the front-end of our platform for the statistical interpretation of genetic data. You will join a cross-functional agile software development team, working with talented software engineers and statistical geneticists within a fast growing start-up company. You should be a highly motivated software professional who continuously seeks to improve the team's software development process. You should enjoy pair programming as an opportunity to share knowledge and exchange ideas.

You should have:

* Proficiency in HTML, CSS and Javascript including at least one of the popular frameworks such as jQuery or AngularJS
* Experience in implementing responsive and engaging user interfaces 
* Basic graphic design and UX skills: ability to create storyboards to present user interface ideas
* Proven experience working with RESTful APIs
* A passion for agile software development practices, including Continuous Delivery and Acceptance Test Driven Development

Ideally you should also have:

* Experience of working with server-side technologies, e.g. Python / Django or Java / Play
* An understanding of software architecture for scalability and maintainability
* An appreciation of data protection and data security issues, and of their implications on system design
* Experience of UX design in a safety-critical application, such as healthcare
* An interest in working for an early-stage start-up company

All candidates must have the right to work in the UK to be considered.

# Overview

We are the Founders Factory, a corporate-backed incubator and accelerator highly capitalized to support investments in early stage UK and European tech businesses and closely affiliated with the Founders Forum, the top network of leading entrepreneurs and corporate leaders in Europe. We are looking to grow the engineering team that forms the core of our incubator lab. This team has the opportunity to work on amazing products across a variety of different technologies and markets.

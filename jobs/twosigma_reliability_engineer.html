![Two Sigma](https://careers.twosigma.com/portal/6/static/img/twosigma.png)

We're not your typical investment manager. We follow principles of technology
and innovation as much as principles of investment management. Fields like
machine learning and distributed computing guide us. Since 2001, we've searched
for ways that these kinds of technologies can make us better at what we do. We
never stop researching and developing.

In the process, we work to help real people. Through our investors, we support
the retirements of millions around the world. And we help fund breakthrough
research, education and a wide range of charities and foundations.

# Reliability Engineer

As a member of this versatile group of full stack engineers, you will be on the
front line for maintaining and expanding the capabilities of Two Sigma's many

administration and development, and seeks to merge the capabilities from both
disciplines. Our remit includes:

* Acting as a conduit between infrastructure and development teams, being
  sympathetic to the concerns and priorities of both;
* Primary operational support for multiple large distributed software
  applications;
* Improving all aspects of software reliability, including better monitoring,
  alerting and documentation;
* Engaging with our software engineering teams on support issues and
  improvements to our tools, processes, and software;
* Gathering and analyzing metrics from both operating systems and applications
  to assist in performance tuning and fault finding.

  scientific discipline.
* Experience with Python (or a high degree of competence in another language
  and a willingness to learn).
* In-depth knowledge and experience in at least one of: host based networking,
  Linux/Unix administration, systems programming, distributed systems,
  databases, and a desire to learn more.
* The ability to quickly leverage off the shelf and open source systems and
  utilities to rapidly provision production systems in a variety of domains,
  especially for multi-tenant use.
* A proven track record of automation and an algorithmic approach to solving
  problems.
* A proactive approach to spotting problems, areas for improvement, performance
  bottlenecks, etc.
* An understanding of the operational concerns in a demanding environment;
  ideally, but not necessarily, finance.

Additional skills preferred:

* Familiar with relational database concepts and have the ability to construct
  at least moderately complex SQL queries.
* Experience with authentication and encryption technologies like SSL, Kerberos
  and GSSAPI.

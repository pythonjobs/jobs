We’re hiring a Python Software Developer to join our interdisciplinary team, working with data publishers and users. To find out more about this role and working at Open Data Services check out this [twitter thread](https://opendataservices.us6.list-manage.com/track/click?u=a9b5f5c33691431ebf7a9e67d&id=f2a54febda&e=293c9e2b0b).

At Open Data Services, we aim to make open data useful, usable and in use. We like to work with projects that combine innovation and engagement to deliver sustainable social impact with open data. We work with transparency initiatives such as Open Contracting, 360 Giving, Open Ownership and the International Aid Transparency Initiative to provide tools and technical assistance to organisations across the world.

We believe in supporting the open data ecosystem. All our tools are open source, and we routinely reuse code across projects & publish our work on GitHub – so we can spend more time improving and tailoring our systems, rather than reinventing the wheel.

We are a worker co-operative. After a probationary period, workers have the right to become members of the co-op, jointly owning and running the business.

We particularly welcome applications from disabled, ethnic minority and women candidates as these groups are underrepresented in our organisation.

**Salary:** £43,120 (full-time equivalent) plus profit share and benefits.<br>
**Location:** Remote, UK-only<br>
**Closing:** 12:00pm, 18th Jul 2022 BST<br>
**Part-time** (0.6 FTE and above) or **full-time** working.

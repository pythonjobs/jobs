Lead Full Stack Django Developer (Remote + Startup)

Tripmap.me is a social map creation platform. We are a team of digital nomads bootstrapping to build an unique product.

We are looking for a lead dev to join the team to build the beta version of Tripmap.

No fancy description needed. We are looking for someone who knows how to get shit done.

You will be working with the PM and a frontend developer.

We are all passionate about the project and our specific roles, and we want to work with a developer who feels the same way. You must be team oriented and able to communicate with other people. Not looking for a rockstar ;) We prefer normal everyday people who just happen to be professionals in their area of expertise.

This is a contract position, however it would ideally be a long term engagement.

Requirements:
Minimum 2 years remote freelancing
Minimum 5 years django development
Experience working with angular or react is an asset
Proven experience building scalable web apps
Ability to give and receive feedback

Please send your application including any relevant repos to dan@tripmap.me

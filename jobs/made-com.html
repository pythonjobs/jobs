# About us

Made.com are a successful ecommerce company with insane growth,  who are
re-engineering for scale. To that end, we're backing HTTP microservices
as an integration strategy for a leaner, meaner service-oriented
architecture.

We're looking for talented hackers to help build our new platform. We're
technology agnostic, but Python is our immediate language of choice.

# About you

* You're opinionated, motivated, and have top-notch OOP and TDD skills.
* You have some familiarity with Python and would like to write more of
it.
* Ideally, you have experience with Docker and AWS, love functional
programming, and would like to play with Go and Scala in a production
environment.
* You have experience with writing and consuming hypermedia APIs and read
the HttpBis specs for fun.

# Skills & Requirements

* Experience with Hypermedia APIs, or event-driven services using a
message bus.
* Excellent TDD and OO skills, experience of DDD a plus.

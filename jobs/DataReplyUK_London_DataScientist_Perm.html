# Overview

We have open positions for Data Scientists to join our growing consultancy startup.

You will be working with the latest tools and technologies but above all else what matters is how you think. We are looking for candidates with a quantitative background. We are particularly interested in speaking with you if you have applied your theoretical understanding to large-scale commercial applications such as a distributed recommender system, for example.

We have openings at different seniority levels. If you meet most but not all requirements your application could still be of interest.



Each project or engagement is different, but in general your aim is to answer a business question using available data, or to build a solution (perhaps a model, recommender, alerting engine or a visualisation tool) to a data-based problem.

Please follow the below URL to apply.

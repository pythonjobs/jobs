# Overview

We are looking to recruit lead developers to help build a brand new education technology web app.

Join a very small and agile product team to help build a completely new product. As one of the app’s first developers, you will be responsible for building the web application, making full stack decisions and preparing for the application’s first live customers. Expect to wear many hats and have lots of control.

Candidates for this role should be fully proficient in Python and Django, with strong full stack skills.

Chalk & Wire and its leaders have been serving education tech since the ‘90s and we have some interesting new ideas on where we want to go next. We operate as a distributed company, working remotely from home (mostly in Ontario). Ideally candidates would operate out of Ottawa or the GTA, and face to face meeting time would be arranged as needed.

We offer competitive salaries and full benefits.

If you’re interested in joining a personally satisfying industry, please send a CV to the address above. Questions always welcome.

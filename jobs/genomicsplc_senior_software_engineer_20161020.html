# Introduction

Genomics plc is an ambitious genome analytics business formed in March 2014 by four leading scientists at the University of Oxford: Peter Donnelly (Director of the Wellcome Trust Centre for Human Genetics), Gil McVean (Director of the Big Data Institute), Gerton Lunter, and Chris Spencer. There will be an explosion in human genomic data linked to health and other phenotypic outcomes and the company’s vision is to bring together these data and develop sophisticated analytical methods for its interpretation in various scientific contexts.  We have already developed the largest genotype-phenotype database of its kind in the world (comprising over 700 studies, almost 3 million participants and 500 unique phenotypes), together with functional genomic data.  We have collaborations with four leading pharmaceutical companies and are a platform partner for the Genomics England 100,000 Genomes Project.  Backed by some of the leading investors in life sciences, Genomics plc now has a cross-disciplinary team of over 30 people, primarily scientists and software engineers, based in central Oxford.
